# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and low-level implementation of various data structures.

## Contents
- Sorting Algorithms: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- Search Algorithms: Binary Search, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search
- Data Structures: Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, HashMaps

## Future Work
- Optimization of algorithms for time and space complexity.
- Addition of more advanced data structures such as Suffix Trees and Red-Black Trees.

## Technologies
- Java
- Unit tests for validation of algorithms.
