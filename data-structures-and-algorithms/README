# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and low-level implementation of various data structures.

## Contents
- Sorting Algorithms: Various iterative and divide & conquer sort implementations 
- Linear Data Structures: ArrayList, LinkedList, and Array-backed Queue implmentation
- Trees: Implementation of BST, AVL Tree, and various BST traversal algorithms
- Graphs: Bellman Ford Shortest Path Algorithm
- Other Data Structures: Min Heaps, HashMaps

## Future Work
- Optimization of algorithms for time and space complexity.
- Addition of dynamic programming algorithm implementations.

## Technologies
- Java
- Unit tests for validation of some algorithms.
