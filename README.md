This repository is a collection of projects showcasing my journey in learning programming and software development. As I explore new technologies, solve problems, and build projects, this repository will continue to grow and evolve. Each project represents a step in my learning process, from foundational concepts in data structures to advanced topics like data engineering and backend development.
